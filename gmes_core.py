"""
The core of G-MES control: one screen, driven completely, without the tool
having been taught that screen first.

This is a library, not a command. The commands are thin callers:

    gmes_report.py          non-interactive: describe / run any UI number
    run_gmes_workflow.py    the by-hand front end
    gmes_daily_prodplan.py  the one hardcoded nightly job

What "control" means here
-------------------------
READ-ONLY. This module opens a screen, sets everything the screen offers,
runs its Inquiry, verifies what came back and exports it. It never clicks
Save, Submit, Approve or Delete, and it has no code path that could
(CLAUDE.md 2.5). Every write it performs goes into a *filter*, which is
input to a query.

The five mechanisms that make any of the 809 screens reachable
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. `gdsMenuList` is a client-side catalogue: menuId <-> sysScreenId <->
   English name <-> breadcrumb. The top search box opens any of them by
   code, so no menu walking (gmes_open_screen.py).
2. `_findForms(screenCode)` walks Nexacro's `_frames` AND its nested
   `Div.form` trees, so a screen is addressable by its stable code while the
   window id (winPPM0219_0_516) is renumbered on every open.
3. `form.binds` maps each control to the dataset column behind it, so a
   screen describes its own filters instead of being taught them.
4. Controls the screen does NOT bind are still typed into, with real key
   events, because a programmatic value assignment fills the box and changes
   nothing Nexacro can see.
5. Results come from the Dataset, never the grid: a Nexacro grid only builds
   the rows you can see, so reading the page turns 5,000 rows into 20 and
   reports success.

The order of operations is not arbitrary
----------------------------------------
    options -> organisation -> dates -> clear stale -> filters -> Inquiry

Switching a category tab or a Quick View REBUILDS the left panel and
discards whatever was set before it, so the panel options go first. Stale
values are cleared after the dates because the dates are values this run
asked for. See GMES_SKILL.md #32 and #34.

Everything here verifies its own outcome. On these systems the normal
failure produces no error at all: a filter that did not take, a query
answered from the previous screen's dataset, an export of the wrong day.

# Running "yesterday" against Create Date instead of Plan Date returns a

# encodes the chosen state in the CSS class, so they can be listed with their
# state and set by label.
# Checkbox state used to be read from a `.checked` CSS class
# (`el.querySelector('.checked')`) - confirmed live, HISTORY.md Phase 69,
# that this Nexacro CheckBox type never adds one at all: its checked/
# unchecked look is drawn by swapping the icon IMG, not by toggling a
# class anywhere in its subtree. `hasCheckedSelector` was `false` both
# before AND after a real, confirmed-working click that correctly flipped
# the component's own `value` between its `truevalue`/`falsevalue` - so
# this test reported "unchecked" 100% of the time regardless of the real
# state. That silently broke two things at once: `set_option()`'s
# already-on guard could never see a checkbox as already checked, and its
# post-click verification could never see one as checked either, so every
# checkbox click - even a fully successful one - ended in "could not prove
# option was selected". Read the component's own `value`/`truevalue`
# instead, resolved from the DOM id by walking it as a `nexacro.
# getApplication()` property path - confirmed live to resolve correctly,
# the same technique `gfnCloseWorkFarme` used for closing a tab (HISTORY.md
# Phase 60). Falls back to the DOM-class heuristic only if that resolution

# Scoped to the CURRENT screen's own window (confirmed live, HISTORY.md
# Phase 65): with three unrelated screens open at once, this used to find
# THREE identical-looking "OrgCategory_GDS.dsCatCommonTreeNodeDVO" trees -
# one per open window, not one per tab on any single screen - because it
# walked `_findForms(null)` with no window filter at all, unlike
# `JS_DISCOVER`. Since every copy shares the exact same form and dataset
# name, no `--tree` value could ever tell them apart, so `select_org()`
# refused to run at all: "'VD' appears in multiple category trees" on a
# screen that, on its own, may not be ambiguous. Left unnoticed until now
# because a single-screen CLI run rarely has another screen already open;
# an interactive session or a batch - the two ways this tool is actually
# used - very often does, since screens are not closed between reports by
# default.

class InquirySettle:
    """The settle-decision core of `poll_inquiry()`, isolated from the
    browser calls so it can be unit-tested against a synthetic sequence of
    row-count readings instead of only ever being verified live.

    Requiring `changed` (the count differing from either the pre-click
    snapshot OR the previous poll) was meant to stop a dataset left
    populated by an earlier run from being mistaken for a finished query.
    Live-traced instead of assumed (HISTORY.md Phase 65.2): replaying
    M4131UM00 with the SAME division right after recording it produced the
    SAME correct 10-row answer, and the count did not merely fail to differ
    from `before` - it stayed at exactly 10 on every single poll, never
    dipping through 0, for 17+ seconds of direct observation. Nexacro does
    not always visibly clear a dataset before refilling it; sometimes a
    re-query updates it in place with no observable transition at all. A
    live probe for any OTHER signal (an overlay/spinner class, the Inquiry
    button's own class toggling) found none either - row count genuinely is
    the only thing available to poll here.

    So `changed` can no longer be a hard requirement without reintroducing
    the 300s hang this was traced to fix, but dropping it outright would
    remove the one thing standing between "the query genuinely re-ran" and
    "the click landed but nothing happened, and stale data is just sitting
    there" - `click_control()` finding and clicking the right element is
    real but not total assurance the query actually ran. The compromise:
    settle quickly (`settle_checks`) when a change WAS observed - the
    common, unambiguous case, unchanged from before - and settle only after
    much longer, sustained stability (`unconfirmed_settle_checks`, default
    3x) when no change was ever observed. Real confidence is still rewarded
    with a fast return; its absence costs patience, not a five-minute
    failure on a result that was correct the entire time.

    A zero count used to be a hard exception to all of this: `step()` reset
    `stable` to 0 on every zero reading and never returned a settled 0, no
    matter how long the count held there. Live-traced (HISTORY.md Phase
    71): a query against a date range with genuinely no matching rows -
    completely ordinary in production, e.g. no orders yet for a future
    date - burned the full 300s `max_wait` and then failed with "the query
    had not settled", every time, for an answer that was correct within a
    second of being clicked. Zero is not special for WHETHER it settles:
    the same asymmetric settle/unconfirmed-settle logic already trusted
    for a nonzero count applies to it too, so a genuinely empty result
    settles rather than an unconditional 300s failure.

    Zero IS treated specially for what counts as evidence of `changed`,
    though - see `step()`'s own docstring (HISTORY.md Phase 82.16): a
    stale nonzero count dropping to 0 on click is NOT trusted as
    confirmation the query re-ran, only as proof the click registered,
    because Nexacro clears the dataset to 0 unconditionally before the
    real answer (0 or otherwise) has arrived - a stable zero always pays
    the full `unconfirmed_settle_checks` patience, whether or not a stale
    nonzero count preceded it."""

        to any other value, so a genuinely empty result settles too, just
        with the same patience an unconfirmed nonzero one already needs.

        Zero IS a special case for what counts as `changed`, though - never
        treated as confirming evidence on its own. Live-caught replaying
        Q2111UM00 (HISTORY.md Phase 82.16): `before` was 175, a stale count
        left over from an earlier successful query on the same screen: the
        very first poll after clicking Inquiry read 0 (Nexacro clears the
        dataset immediately, unconditionally, before the server has
        answered at all - true whether the real answer will be 0 or 175
        again), `count != self.before` fired, `changed` became True, and
        the FAST threshold accepted 4 consecutive 0-reads as "confirmed" -
        while the real answer, also 175, was still in flight and arrived
        moments later. A direct manual re-click of the same Inquiry, same
        filters, immediately afterward returned 175 correctly, proving the
        data was never the problem - only how fast 0 was trusted. Zero
        during a round trip is NOT distinguishable, from a single reading,
        between "still clearing" and "the real, final answer" - so it
        never contributes to `changed` on its own. Only a NONZERO reading

    """Click Inquiry and wait for THIS screen's result set to settle.

    Polling a dataset by a hardcoded name reported 875 rows - the count still
    sitting in the PREVIOUS screen's dataset - for a screen that had returned
    17. The export was right because it used the discovered dataset; only the
    number and the wait were wrong, which is the more dangerous combination:
    the file is correct, the log lies, and nobody checks.

    An empty result set does not mean the query finished either. Nexacro
    clears the dataset the instant Inquiry is pressed and refills it when the
    server answers, so the count sits at 0 for the whole round trip. Treating
    ANY stable zero as settled immediately reported 0 rows and refused to
    export while 790 rows were on their way.

    So: prefer the count to have been seen CHANGING, so a dataset left
    populated by an earlier run - or, symmetrically, a zero-row round trip
    still in flight - is not mistaken for a finished query on its first
    stable reading. Zero itself is not otherwise a special case (Phase 71):
    a genuinely empty result settles the same way an unconfirmed nonzero one
    does, after sustained stability, not never. Neither cap is an estimate of
    how long the query takes - the loop exits the moment it has its answer,
    which is what makes a generous cap free.

    "Changed" cannot be a hard requirement, though - confirmed by two rounds
    of live investigation, not assumed (HISTORY.md Phase 65.2). Replaying
    M4131UM00 with the same division right after recording it produced the
    same correct 10-row answer, and directly tracing the poll loop showed
    the count sitting at exactly 10 on EVERY single reading, never dipping
    through 0, for 17+ seconds - not merely "equal to the pre-click value",
    genuinely never changing at all, poll to poll, the whole time. A
    fresh query with an unchanged, correct answer can look, from row count
    alone, IDENTICAL to a click that silently did nothing. A live search for
    any other observable signal (a busy overlay, the Inquiry button's own
    class toggling) found none either - row count is genuinely all there is
    to poll on this screen. See `InquirySettle`'s docstring for how the two

#
# HISTORY.md - external review of 1957ba9/cff282b, finding #14/32: row-count
# settling (InquirySettle above) cannot tell "the click landed and the
# server answered" apart from "the click did nothing and stale data just
# sat there" - both can look identical from row count alone (Phase 65.2's
# own finding). Live-traced rather than guessed at (Phase 82.6): every
# Inquiry click on P1112UM00 produced one or more `POST .../nexacro.do`
# requests (Nexacro's own server-transaction servlet - observed on this
# account as both `.../sm/nexacro.do` and `.../pm/nexacro.do`, the module
# prefix following the screen), each answered with HTTP 200 and a real
# response body (519,530 bytes for a 738-row query; 9,000 bytes for a
# smaller accompanying call the same click also produced). This is that
# evidence, made checkable: TransactionProof is the pure decision logic,
# tested offline against synthetic events; watch_nexacro_transaction() is
# the live glue, using a connection dedicated to events only - see
# cdp_common.open_event_listener()'s own docstring for why sharing the
# evaluate() connection would silently lose these events.
#
# NOT yet wired into poll_inquiry() as a required check: confirmed live
# only on this one screen and account so far, and doing so would mean
# passing every caller's target websocket URL through Screen/open_screen()
# for a connection that today only exists here. Available as a
# supplementary, opt-in check a caller can use directly; making it the
# default is the natural next step, tracked as an open item.

    `expected_fingerprint` (and the recording's `grid_aliases`): when a recording
    exists, "built" means "has the shape the recording saw", for up to
    `shape_grace` seconds after the counts settle - see the loop below.

    Both halves matter. A background screen still accepts dataset writes, so
    filters apply cleanly and the Inquiry click then lands on whichever screen
    is really in front - that produced a run which set the date and division
    correctly, queried a completely different report, and reported zero rows.

    And a tab existing is not the same as a screen being built: Nexacro
    constructs the whole UI in JavaScript long after the tab appears, so this
    polls for the screen's own forms rather than reading them once and
    declaring the screen unreadable.

    "Has a grid or a filter" is not the same as "is finished". Confirmed live
    on P1114WM00 (HISTORY.md Phase 62): its category tree and result grid are
    ready almost immediately, so the old one-shot check returned right away -
    but the screen's own "Detail" filter panel (a reusable Widget Filter
    component, the same late-binding pattern already known from the Quick
    View widget) attaches `Module Name`, `MES P/O`, `Mail` and `PO` several
    seconds LATER. A run recorded at the first "ready" moment never saw those
    fields at all - not an error, just a screen offer and a set of settable
    filters that were quietly short. So readiness now requires the discovered
    shape (filter/unbound/grid counts) to read the SAME on two consecutive
    polls, the same settle discipline `poll_inquiry` already uses for the
    result count, before this screen is handed to the caller.

    Closing every OTHER open screen first was tried (HISTORY.md Phase 62.5)
    to stop a Quick View sibling's leftover filter form leaking into this
    screen's own discovery (P1114WM01 left `workYmd`/`poNo`/`modelCode` in
    P1114WM00 after a switch), and reverted the same session: it traded that
    problem for a worse one. Confirmed live over a 90s trace - a fully cold
    P1114WM00, opened with NOTHING else already open, never populated its
    own Detail filter widget at all (`Module Name`, `MES P/O`, `Mail`, `PO`
    stayed missing the entire time). P1114WM00 is a "Detail Schedule"
    child of P1114UM00 in the menu breadcrumb, and every prior successful
    discovery of it happened with P1114UM00 already open alongside it - the
    widget filter panel appears to depend on that parent screen's own
    state to populate, so force-closing "everything but the target" closed
    something this screen actually needed. The narrower Quick View
    contamination is not reachable through the normal front end any more
    (`run_gmes_workflow.py`'s Quick View question was reverted to
    informational-only in the same session), so there is nothing left in
    this codebase that opens a Quick View sibling programmatically - the
