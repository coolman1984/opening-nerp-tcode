"""
The G-MES report tool, for people - the front end behind GMES_Workflow.bat.

    python run_gmes_workflow.py
    (or double-click GMES_Workflow.bat)

A menu, a few short questions, then the work, narrated as numbered steps.
The menu shows before anything signs in - viewing what is already saved
needs no browser at all.

The one idea worth understanding
--------------------------------
The tool has a MEMORY. The first time a screen is used it works everything
out from the screen itself and, if the run fully succeeds, writes down the
two things it cannot work out again - which box is the "from" date, and which
table holds the results. That is the RECORDING phase, and it happens by
itself; there is no separate command.

Every run after that is the REPLAYING phase: it checks the screen still
matches what it wrote down, and reuses it. If anything has moved it says so
and reads the screen from scratch instead. It never quietly guesses.

The banner before the work says which of the two is about to happen.

All of the drawing lives in gmes_ui, which degrades to plain ASCII when the
console cannot do better. Presentation never decides anything.
