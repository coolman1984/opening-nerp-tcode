GMES login - unattended.

    python gmes_login.py                    # open GMES, sign in, clear popups
    python gmes_login.py --show-browser     # same, but watch it happen
    python gmes_login.py --status           # just report where we are
    python gmes_login.py --refresh-profile  # re-copy your Chrome profile first
    python gmes_login.py --assist           # you sign in by hand, once
    python gmes_login.py --allow-password-login   # see the warning below

**A failed corporate sign-in is not a failed password.** If AD SSO does not
complete, this stops. It does NOT fall through to typing the saved password
into G-MES's own login form, because that form counts every refusal against
a five-attempt lockout, and an SSO window that never opened says nothing
about whether the password is right. `--allow-password-login` permits one
such attempt, deliberately off by default (HISTORY.md Phase 74).

`--refresh-profile` re-copies your real Chrome profile over the automated
browser's copy. Every Chrome window must be closed first, because Chrome
keeps its cookie and login databases locked while it runs.

**Use it only as a last resort.** The G-MES session that makes sign-in
instant lives in the COPY, and refreshing OVERWRITES it - so a browser that
was signing in by itself stops doing so, and has to authenticate for real
again. That is exactly what happened once here: a refresh threw away a
working session, and the sign-in failures that followed were then blamed on
the password and the account. If sign-in is working, leave the profile
alone.

Designed to run at night with nobody watching, so it never asks a question:
the credentials come from the encrypted store (gmes_credentials.py), and
every wait polls for the thing it needs instead of sleeping a guessed
number of seconds.

The flow it handles, in order:
  1. No automation browser running         -> start it on the tool's own
                                              profile (built on the first run
                                              from the Chrome/Edge profile you
                                              already use - HISTORY.md Phase 75).
  2. Not on GMES                           -> navigate there.
  3. Already signed in                     -> skip straight to step 6.
  4. GMES login screen                     -> click "AD SSO Login".
  5. Samsung SSO sign-in page              -> fill ID + password, submit.
  6. Notice popups covering the screen     -> close each one by its X.

    Phase 76.5; CLAUDE.md 2.5 forbids writing a value in the target system
    without explicit confirmation, and doing this every run IS that
    confirmation, given by the project owner - HISTORY.md Phase 77).

    **Verified live to be purely cosmetic.** `Network.enable` plus a 3-second
    capture around the click saw zero requests: the click swaps an
    already-downloaded message bundle client-side and writes nothing to the

    It does **not** persist across a reload or a fresh navigation (no cookie,

    this runs every time a fresh login form is reached, not once. A failure
    here is never fatal to signing in: the label language has no bearing on
    which control gets clicked, since every one of them is already addressed
    by a fixed id or class, never by text (CLAUDE.md 3.3).

    The probe requires both toggle statics to be visible and in the viewport

    """Wait for the Samsung SSO window THIS run's own click opened - or for
    the sign-in to complete without one - or for G-MES to say it refused.

    `windows_before` is the set of window ids captured right before AD SSO
    was clicked; only a window that did not exist then can be this run's own
    (see `find_new_sso_window()`'s docstring for the live leftover-popup risk
    this closes).

    Clicking AD SSO does not always open a window. When a session cookie has
    survived in the profile, G-MES signs straight back in and no SSO page is
    ever shown. Waiting only for the window then fails the whole run with
    "the Samsung SSO window never opened" while the user is, in fact, already
    signed in.

    And it does not always succeed. When G-MES refuses, it writes the reason
    onto its own login form ("Auth bad credentials") and then nothing further
    happens - no window, no session, no error thrown. Waiting the full 45s
    for a window that is never coming, while the reason sits on screen, is
    the difference between a run that explains itself and one that hangs.

    A message on the page NEVER decides anything, and an earlier version of
    this let it. It returned "rejected" as soon as 'Auth bad credentials' had
    been showing for a few seconds - while the Samsung ADFS window was still
    on its way, and while the message itself was often left over from a
    previous attempt. That false alarm cost three wrong diagnoses and a
    needless manual sign-in.

    **The outcome is deliberately named "no-window", not "rejected"**
    (HISTORY.md Phase 74). The SSO window failing to appear says nothing
    whatsoever about whether the credentials are good: the window can be
    swallowed by a Chrome popup policy (GMES_SKILL #51), lost to a network
    problem, or - live-observed - simply not appear when the same account is
    being signed in from a second browser profile. Calling that "rejected"
    is what led the caller to "fix" it by submitting a password, which
    burned a real attempt against the account's lockout counter for a
    password that was almost certainly correct.

    The logic:

        signed in            -> done, whatever the page says
        a NEW SSO window      -> go and fill it in
        more than one NEW SSO window -> ("ambiguous", count) - stop, do not guess
        neither, for the full wait -> ("no-window", whatever the page said)
                                      where the message is a DIAGNOSTIC only
