"""
Browser-neutral Chromium handling: discovery, profile enumeration, and the
FIRST-RUN bootstrap that gives the automation the browser environment the
employee already uses with G-MES.

Why this module exists
----------------------
HISTORY.md Phase 73.1 replaced the copied profile with one the tool builds
empty, because a copied profile **cannot be shipped**: Chrome 140+ wraps every
cookie on Windows in App-Bound Encryption whose key is bound to the machine,
so a profile copied to a DIFFERENT PC decrypts nothing (GMES_SKILL.md #1).
That reasoning is about *distribution*, and it still holds - nothing here
changes it.

It was never an argument against copying a profile **on the machine it was
made on**, which is the one case where the encryption works perfectly. A new
user on a new PC is already signed in to G-MES in their own Edge or Chrome;
starting from an empty profile throws that away and makes them sit through an
ADFS round trip that can fail for reasons unrelated to their password
(Phase 74.1 - and a failed corporate sign-in is the most expensive failure
this project has, because the old code answered it by spending one of five
attempts before the account locks).

So: on first run only, copy the profile they already use; afterwards, reuse
the copy exactly as before. If anything about that is not possible - no
supported browser, no usable profile, a locked file, a copy that fails
halfway - fall back to the empty tool-built profile from Phase 73, which is
still a completely working path.

The rules this module must not break
------------------------------------
* CLAUDE.md 2.1 / 2.1a - the user's real profile is **read-only** here. It is
  never launched, never debugged, never written to, never deleted. Neither is
  an automation profile that has already been onboarded: recovery is always
  ADDITIVE (a new directory beside the old one), never a reset.
* CLAUDE.md 2.6 - a browser that is in the way is reported, never killed.
* CLAUDE.md 3.1 - nothing here sleeps a fixed duration.
* CLAUDE.md 3.5 - a copy that returned without error is not a copy that
  worked. `_verify_copy()` checks the files that carry the session.

Browser-neutral means browser-neutral: Chrome and Edge differ by a table
entry (`BROWSERS`), not by a code path. Adding Brave or Vivaldi later is a
row, not a fork.

Read-only self-check, safe to run at any time:
