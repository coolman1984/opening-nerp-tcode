# Capability rescue record

The former `src/gmes` donor package was removed in HISTORY.md Phase 57. It
is recoverable only from Git commit `59eb838` / branch
`archive/standalone-gmes-before-removal`; it is not executable in this tree.
The flat root modules are the sole supported G-MES engine.

| Capability | Final disposition | Evidence / boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Popup-blocking flag | IMPLEMENTED MINIMALLY | `--disable-popup-blocking` is live-proven in the donor incident and ported only to the G-MES profile launcher. |
| Strict G-MES screenshot targeting | IMPLEMENTED MINIMALLY | G-MES snapshots require the exact `seegmes4.sec.samsung.net` page; no verified tab means no screenshot. Shared N-ERP selection is unchanged. |
| SSO auth allowlist flags | DISCARDED WITH EVIDENCE | Phase 56.3 observed a 200 HTML ADFS form, not a Negotiate challenge. |
| SSO diagnostic | IMPLEMENTED MINIMALLY | `gmes_sso_diagnose.py` is read-only and uses flat imports. |
| Production-plan recipe | ALREADY COVERED BY LEGACY | `gmes_daily_prodplan.py` has its specialised subtotal policy and atomic CSV write. |
| Command validation | ALREADY COVERED BY LEGACY | `gmes_report.py` validates before browser side effects. |
| Record/replay opening shape | IMPLEMENTED MINIMALLY | Opening and post-option fingerprints are stored and checked at their respective lifecycle points. |
| Popup close / export retry | NEEDS LIVE EVIDENCE | Base legacy mechanisms exist; donor refinements are not ported without legacy-path proof. |
| Watchdog + heartbeat | NEEDS LIVE EVIDENCE | Shared-log-mtime is explicitly rejected. A future watchdog needs a PID/run-scoped heartbeat. |
| Checkpoint/resume | NEEDS LIVE EVIDENCE | Correctness requires a write after each verified screen success inside the run loop. |
| Recovery ladder / browser fallback | PRESERVED AS DESIGN KNOWLEDGE | Not replaced by a watchdog; never refresh the protected profile automatically. |
| Circuit breaker / alerts / locking | PRESERVED AS DESIGN KNOWLEDGE | Offline donor experiments do not justify growing the supported core. Alert credentials must remain separate DPAPI data and encrypted SMTP only. |
| Paged reads / streaming CSV | NEEDS LIVE EVIDENCE | The legacy reader remains materialised; donor paging was not live-verified. |
| Doctor / runtime-path consolidation | PRESERVED AS DESIGN KNOWLEDGE | Useful ideas, no supported-runtime regression requiring a new architecture. |
| Atomic writes | ALREADY COVERED BY LEGACY / NEEDS EVIDENCE | Profiles and CSV use replace; credential-store hardening needs separate evidence. |
| Project Eye | IMPLEMENTED MINIMALLY | Root governance tests enforce the one-engine truth. |

## Superseded proposals

Earlier proposals to extract a watchdog from shared log mtime, to treat a
restart as a recovery ladder, or to build a zero-edit external checkpoint
were rejected. They are unsafe or incomplete for the supported flat runtime.
They are lessons, not instructions to recreate the donor architecture.
