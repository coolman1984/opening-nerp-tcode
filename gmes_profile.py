"""
What the tool remembers about a G-MES screen after a run that actually
worked - step 9 of the basic workflow, and nothing more.

A profile is NOT a recording. It holds no coordinates, no window ids, no
dataset contents. It holds three kinds of thing:

  * which control this screen means by "from", "to" and "division"
  * which grid holds the result
  * a fingerprint of the screen as it was when the run succeeded

Everything else is rediscovered on every run, because it is cheap and always
true. The profile only answers the questions discovery cannot: on a screen
with three date fields, which one did the run that worked actually use?

Why so little is saved
----------------------
G-MES renumbers a screen's ids on every open (winPPM0219_0_516 ->
winPPM0219_0_315), so anything positional is stale before it is even reused.
And the worst bug in this project's history came from reusing a remembered
dataset name: a run reported 875 rows - the previous screen's count - when
the screen had returned 17. So what is saved here is deliberately limited to
names that are stable by construction, and every one of them is checked
against the live screen before it is trusted.

Fields are copied out by name, one at a time. That is an allowlist, and it
is deliberate: a G-MES form tree contains live session tokens (an ordinary
looking `dsAnyframeDVO` carries `tokenId` and `refreshTokenId`), so anything
that serialised "whatever was discovered" would write credentials to disk.

    "the screen's controls have changed" and threw away what it had just
    learned - a memory that erases itself on every run is worse than none,
    because it also cries wolf.
