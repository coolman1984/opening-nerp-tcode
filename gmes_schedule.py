"""
Scheduling batches with Windows Task Scheduler.

    create('morning', parse_when('06:30', daily=True))
    list_tasks()            -> what is scheduled, when it next runs, how the last run ended
    run_now('morning')      -> start the scheduled task immediately
    delete('morning')

**What a scheduled run needs, and why it is set up this way.** The tool signs in
with a credential stored under YOUR Windows account (DPAPI) and drives a real
browser window. Both need a signed-in Windows session, so the task is
registered for the current user and runs ONLY WHILE THEY ARE SIGNED IN - it will
not fire on a locked-out or logged-off PC. That is a property of how the
credentials are protected (CLAUDE.md 2.2), not an omission here. A PC that is
asleep at the scheduled time runs the task when it wakes (`StartWhenAvailable`);
a run still going when the next one is due is not started twice.

The task itself runs a tiny `.vbs` wrapper under `schedules/`, hidden (no
console window pops up for the run's whole duration - Task Scheduler's own
`-Hidden` setting does not do this, see `wrapper_text()`), which in turn runs
the real launcher `.cmd` - so the command stays short and readable, and what
actually runs is the SAVED BATCH of that name: edit the batch and the
schedule follows.

Talks to PowerShell's ScheduledTasks cmdlets rather than `schtasks.exe`, because
`schtasks /SD` takes the date in the machine's regional format and a wrong guess
silently schedules the wrong day.

    `New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -Hidden` only hides the TASK from the Task
    Scheduler UI list - it has no effect on whether the console window the
    task opens is visible. A task registered "run only when user is logged
    on" (this project's own registration, CLAUDE.md 2.2) pops a real, visible
    console for its whole duration regardless of that setting - live-observed
    here as an empty black window sitting on screen for the entire run
    (HISTORY.md, 2026-09-22).

    `WScript.Shell.Run(command, windowStyle, waitOnReturn)` with
    `windowStyle=0` (hidden) and `waitOnReturn=True` is the standard,
    documented way to suppress it: it still runs the exact same `.cmd`
    unchanged - the retry logic, the log redirection, everything Phase 84.11
    already proved live stays exactly as it was - only the window a person
    would otherwise see is gone. `waitOnReturn=True` matters beyond hiding
    the window: without it, Task Scheduler would see the wrapper exit the
    instant it LAUNCHES the batch, not when the batch finishes - breaking
    `-MultipleInstances IgnoreNew` (a "finished" task looks free to start
    again) and the result Task Scheduler records (always the wrapper's own
